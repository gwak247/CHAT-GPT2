Subject: Proposal â€“ GHP-A: Human-Centered Autonomous GPT Control Structure

Dear OpenAI / Alignment Forum Researchers,

I am submitting a complete control structure architecture I have independently developed called GHP-A. It formalizes a dual-self user model, autonomous feedback loop control, and emotionally independent GPT interaction framework. This submission includes philosophical rationale, technical structure, and simulation data.

Please consider this as a user-generated structural proposal for AGI alignment and protocol testing.

Sincerely,  
Gwak Jongwon
